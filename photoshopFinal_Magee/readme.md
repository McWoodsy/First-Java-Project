This is my first ever Java project. It's a hypothetical photo printing store with basic funcitonality.

I've learned a lot from this project, and had a lot of fun making it. I'm quite proud of it but I see a lot of places
for improvement. There is a lot of refactoring to be done, and plenty of argument validation and error handling too.
Some UI aspects were totally overlooked as well, but I guess that just means my next app will be more air tight :)

Overall, not bad for a first ever Java app!
